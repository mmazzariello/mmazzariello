### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mariana

I have a background in human resources and art. I'm passionate about tech and its intersection with people. I'm excited for the journey ahead to become a SOFTWARE engineer. I'm looking forward to joining teams delivering delightful and valuable experiences to users.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

ðŸ¥° I love sunny days, photography, design, psychology, maths, writing, meditating, dancing, drawing and above all spending quality time with people I love.
